The World Wide Web is is group of computers all connected to each other using a network called the internet. Computers on the web can be split in two groups, servers and clients. The servers store all the data and files that are used to build a website. Clients computers display websites using web browers. When a user clicks on a link in a web browser a request for files is sent from the client computer to the server computer. The server will then send back the requested files to client and it will build a website with these files using a web browser.

This request is usually completed using a protocol called HTTP, which stand for Hyper-Text-Transfer-Protocol. An HTTP request is a standarized protocol that is used send data like HTML, CSS and Javascript to and from web servers and web browser. HTML files are used to display markup and content, CSS files are used to style markup, and Javascript files are used handle interactivity from the user. Request can also be broken into four diffrent types: Get, Post, Pull, and delete. Get request are used when a client wants to request data from a server. Post request are used when a client wants to send data to server and create a new data entry. Put request are used when a client wants to update existing data on a server. Lastly, delete request are used when a client wants to delete an existing data entry on a server.
